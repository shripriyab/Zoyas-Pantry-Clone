    shortDescription:
      "Roasted almond oil is an outstanding product in the kitchen. With its fresh roasted almond flavour, the oil reveals subtle nuances when combined with other ingredients. Its delicate character makes it a good substitute for olive oil in cases where walnut oil and hazelnut oil are just too powerful. When combined with any salad, fish or vegetable dish, almond oil helps to fashion a gourmet meal. Almond oil is very popular in India with duck and curry, and in China it is also used with chicken and duck. Give almond oil a try - you are sure to love it. After harvesting, the nuts are washed, sorted, sun-dried for several days and stored for further drying. The almonds are then ground and roasted in cast-iron kettles. The resulting warm paste is pressed in a hydraulic press. Following mechanical extraction, the oil is lightly filtered and bottled.",
